# Basic Data Analysis with AI using Streamlit

This repository provides a simple example of performing basic data analysis using AI and visualizing the results with Streamlit. The analysis is done through the `main.py` script, and you'll need to provide your API key in the `secret.py` file to access the necessary services.

## Setup

To get started with the data analysis and visualization, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-data-analysis-with-ai.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd basic-data-analysis-with-ai
   ```

3. Create a new file named `secret.py` in the same directory.

4. Open `secret.py` in a text editor and add your API key like this:

   ```python
   # secret.py

   openapi_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.

5. Save and close the `secret.py` file.

6. Make sure you have a CSV file that you want to analyze. Ensure that the CSV file size is below 200 MB.

7. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Analysis and Visualization

1. Ensure that you have completed the setup steps mentioned above.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/basic-data-analysis-with-ai
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit script using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

   The script will start a local development server and open a web browser displaying the Streamlit app. You can interact with the app to perform data analysis and view the results.

## Important Note

- Do not upload your actual API key or sensitive information to any public repository. The `secret.py` file is added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental uploads.

- Keep the size of the CSV file below 200 MB to ensure efficient processing.

- The Streamlit app created by `main.py` provides a user-friendly interface for data analysis and visualization.

- This is a basic example and can be extended to perform more complex data analysis and visualization tasks using AI techniques and Streamlit.
